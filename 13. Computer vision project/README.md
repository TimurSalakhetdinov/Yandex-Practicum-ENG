**Project - Determination of the age of buyers**

The Khleb-Sol chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photo fixation in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
* Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
* Control the conscientiousness of cashiers when selling alcohol.

We will build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. We have at our disposal a set of photographs of people with age indications.

Project implementation instructions:
* Conduct an exploratory analysis of a set of photographs.
* Prepare data for training.
* Train a neural network and calculate its quality.
