**Project - Forecasting taxi orders**

The Clear Taxi company has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during the peak period, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. Let's build a model for such a prediction.

The value of the RMSE metric on the test sample should be no more than 48.

We need:

* Download data and resample it one hour at a time.
* Analyze data.
* Train different models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample of 10% of the original data.
* Check the data on the test sample and draw conclusions.
* The data is in the taxi.csv file. The number of orders is in the num_orders column.

**Data Description**

The data is in the /datasets/taxi.csv file.

The number of orders is in the 'num_orders' column.
